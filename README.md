# Timewheel

> No schedule.

Most of program languages already implemented time wheel data structure, why did I make new one? That's good question! As we all see here, alphalgo is mainly about open data structure which is expanded from common ones. Also timewheel means that, but it's different with original time wheel data structure. I made some new stuffs here, please pay attention on it, let's go.
